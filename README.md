To submit a writeup, fork the repository, clone your fork, add your writeup, and send a pull request. For more details, check out GitHub's tutorial on [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and submitting a [pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) request.

If it doesn't already exist in the repository, go ahead and create the /<year>/<ctfname>/<challenge-name> directory and add your writeup there.

You can use the following template for your write-up:

```

Embed images using: ![](/<year>/<ctfname>/<challenge-name>/img.png)
